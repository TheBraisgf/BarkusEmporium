# Barkus Emporium

**Barkus Emporium** is an exciting indie game created by three passionate newcomers to the world of game development. Enter a world full of diversity, where humanoids of different animal races coexist harmoniously, yet face a looming threat challenging their peaceful existence.

This project is our personal journey into game development. By exploring the code and assets, we aim to gain valuable insights into Unity game development, including game mechanics, scripting, and asset management. Our ultimate goal is to leverage this knowledge to create my very own video game by 2024.

## Roadmap

#### **Phase Zero**

Phase Zero will include the minimum viable product, the simplest game mechanics to make it playable. All with the intention of listening to the community through social networks and implementing the ideas that we have in the team along with those that we like the most from the public.

- Simple shop mechanic
- Player movement
- Sellable items
- Basic NPC choices
- Simple lateral scroll platforms
- First enemy
- Random rewards
- First skills

#### **Phase One**

Phase one is more elaborate. After a first (and possibly boring phase zero) we will have a base on which to work our ideas and those of the community

- More NPC
- Redesign and style
- Inventory and panels
- Shop slots
- Shop first personalization
- More enemies
- New mechanics
- New Skills
